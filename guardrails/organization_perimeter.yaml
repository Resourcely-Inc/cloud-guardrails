  - External/third party accounts should be inventoried in a central location, along with relationship/justification

  While sharing AWS resources with external entities is a common industry practice, these integration points constitute areas of high potential risk and can blur the lines between partner integrations and cloud compromise scenarios.

  It's a good security practice to treat your company's Organization as a perimeter, and require explicit cataloging of other AWS accounts and entities which extend that perimeter.

  An audit of this perimeter can be performed in a number of ways, such as:
  - Checking resource policies in AWS Config to view external trusted accounts
  - Checking AWS CloudTrail for interactions with external accounts (extra useful if CloudTrail Data Events are enabled)
  - Checking S3 access logs for incoming requests from external principals

  Keeping this inventory up to date and performing continuous audits will help to keep the perimeter well-maintained over time and can be an excellent way to discover unapproved or unchecked integrations. If the volume grows over time, consider consolidating these perimeter-expansion points to a particular account or organization OU.
