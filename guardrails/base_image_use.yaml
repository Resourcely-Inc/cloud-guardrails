description: |
  The standardization benefits of using base images only apply if the software and customizations within those base images are up to date. As new base images are created, subsequent AMI bakes should switch over to those new images with minimal delay.

  Periodic, automated cleanup of base images can help avoid accidental usage of old + undesirable base images.
