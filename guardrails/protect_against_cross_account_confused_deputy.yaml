description: | 
  The External ID is a critical security mechanism used when delegating access to AWS resources to third parties through IAM roles, 
  that can be used to mitigate the cross-account confused deputy problem. The cross-account confused deputy problem in AWS occurs when 
  a third-party application mistakenly uses its permissions to access resources unintentionally on behalf of another party, 
  in this case via a role assumption. This identifier acts as an additional layer of security, ensuring that the IAM role cannot 
  be assumed without the specific External ID, which is known only to the owner account and the third party. It helps to prevent 
  the third-party application from being used as a confused deputy, i.e., from being coerced into acting on behalf of a malicious actor.
  
  The external ID should be a unique identifier that cannot be easily guessed, such as an invoice number or UUID, 
  rather than predictable information like a name or phone number. This ID must be provided by the third party when 
  they attempt to assume the role, ensuring that only authorized entities can access the resources.
