  To securely serve static assets over the internet, use a private bucket with a Content Delivery Network (CDN) front-end, 
  instead of making the bucket itself public. This provides several advantages over using a public bucket to serve static assets.
  
  Increased security and control: Public buckets are accessible to anyone on the internet, which can lead to unintentional or malicious access. 
  CDN's give you more control over who can access assets, as opposed to the blanket act of making an entire bucket public. 
  Using signed URLs, you can specify the amount of time that a URL is valid, configure custom headers, or set up signed cookies to control access to your content.
  You can also specify certain properties and conditions to be true in which a user can access your content. 
  Things like restricting by a specific geographic location or IP address can provide an extra layer of security against unauthorized access to your content. 
  Ultimately, there are more granular security settings using a CDN as opposed to a public bucket. 
  
  
  Better Performance: Using a CDN can help improve performance by delivering content from edge locations that are closer to your end-users, 
  reducing latency and improving load times. 
  
  Lower Costs: 
    - With a private bucket and a CDN front-end, you can often reduce your costs by only paying for the data transfer and storage that you actually use. 
    - Offloading bandwidth usage to the CDN instead of serving the assets directly from the private bucket.
