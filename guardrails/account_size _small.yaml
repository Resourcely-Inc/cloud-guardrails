how_to:

description: |
  Account is the permissions boundary. Account is also a blast radius boundary. 
  Although you can do some IAM conditionals based on tags it is complex and doesn't work for all cases / all services.  
  You want to use an account per app or even smaller.  
  With smaller accounts, the side effect is you are going to have a lot of accounts.  
  They need to be automated in creation and deletion of accounts. 
  This also can create a lot of VPC's unless you share them.  
  You also have to connect the VPC's through peering or TGW.
