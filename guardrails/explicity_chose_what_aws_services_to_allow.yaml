description: |
  Specifically allow (enable list) what AWS services you want your teams to use in that account.  
  Otherwise teams will use everything and your cyber / arch / support risk footprints are huge and even more difficult to manage.  
  Also, if you don't do this, when AWS releases a new service, everyone gets it whether you want folks using it then or not.  
  Even if the service isn't targeted at your company type for the implementation.
