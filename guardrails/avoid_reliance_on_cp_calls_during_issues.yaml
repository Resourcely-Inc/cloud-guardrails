  Control planes prioritize consistency over availability when issues occur.  
  Also, if there is a partial service outage, think of how AWS customers are going to try to fix their apps through automation or humans.  
  AWS has a HUGE customer base. When issues happen the AWS control plane API calls will most likely rate limit and throttle very quickly.
  Dataplanes prioritize availability and are setup for this.
  But Route53 DNS control planes changes can rate limit.  
  Setup Route53 so the failover is already setup using health checks (which is the dataplane).
