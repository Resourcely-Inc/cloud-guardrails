  This does not apply if there is no guardrail to prevent the creation of new VPCs with NAT/Internet gateways. 
  If a user can create a new public VPC, they could theoretically bypass this egress proxy.

summary: To prevent malicious or accidental exfiltration of data, all outbound traffic should be routed through managed edge components.

  Outbound traffic to the public internet should be routed through an egress proxy with an explicit allowlist of public addresses. 
  This provides improved visibility into the traffic leaving the network. 
  An explicit allowlist of public addresses can help enforce security policies by limiting access to approved destinations and blocking
  unauthorized access to the public internet.
  
  It's important to note that a VPC needs to be configured correctly to use the egress proxy, and that the creation of new VPCs with 
  Internet or NAT Gateways can bypass this egress proxy to access the public internet directly. 
  This is only effective if there is limited ability to create new Internet or NAT Gateways.
  
  Traffic to cloud provider API endpoints and partner private links should be routed through provider-controlled private endpoints exposed to the VPC. 
  For AWS, use VPC Endpoints. For GCP, use Private Service Connect. By using these  provider-controlled private endpoints, traffic to cloud provider 
  API endpoints/partner private links does not traverse the public internet. 
  There may be some performance benefits as well, as private endpoints are typically closer to the destination and have higher bandwidth and lower latency.
