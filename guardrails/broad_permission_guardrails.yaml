  - Usage of "*:*" permissions, "AdministratorAccess", and various "FullAccess" policies confer permissions that are likely overscoped.
  - While it's difficult to enumerate all of these, the most likely ones are a finite and auditable number.

  For many organizations, true least privilege within AWS is either unattainable or undesirable (within reason). However, there are many milestones between least privilege and unchecked AWS access.

  For both customer and AWS managed IAM policies, broad use of "*:*", AdministratorAccess, and various FullAccess (ex: IAMFullAccess) policies should be a rare enough occurrence that they are subject to additional friction or review. These types of permissions are extremely difficult to reclaim once given out and are best addressed upfront.

  Adding additional checks/processes/detections in-line with these permission updates can help to identify not just accidental misconfiguration, but also common privilege escalation paths in post-compromise scenarios.

  In the event that these checks are overly noisy or difficult to operationalize, it may be an indication that excessive permissions are being given out.
