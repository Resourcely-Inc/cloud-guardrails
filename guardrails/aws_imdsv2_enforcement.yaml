description: |
  This is a best practice and will save you a ton in response and remediation for SSRD vulnerabilities.
  The main value is protecting AWS credentials from SSRF vectors which you are bound to be exposed to at some point.
  Just do it always assuming the vendor software you run on your servers support it.
