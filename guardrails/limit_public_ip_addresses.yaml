description: | 
  Traffic from the public internet to services running on the cloud should be centralized through ingress proxies. 
  
  By centralizing inbound network access, you gain greater control and manageability over your network. 
  You can enforce security policies and access controls in a single location, which can simplify network management and reduce the risk of misconfigurations.
  This reduces the attack surface to external actors whose only access is to cloud resources through public endpoints. 
  A proxy can also provide us with centralized visibility into all inbound traffic. 
  
  There are additional performance and scalability benefits to a centralized ingress proxy. 
  Caching frequently accessed content and distributing traffic across multiple backend servers/services can help ensure that services are highly available and responsive, even under heavy load.
