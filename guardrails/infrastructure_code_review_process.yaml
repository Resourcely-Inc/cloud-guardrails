  Requiring infrastructure code to pass security linting checks before merging pull requests (PRs) to convergence branches is a critical 
  security measure that can help prevent security issues from being introduced into the production environment. 
  This enables the detection and prevention of security misconfigurations at build time to prevent vulnerable/misconfigured infrastructure 
  from ever being deployed. Insecure changes will be prevented before any infrastructure is actually spun up and real-time, 
  actionable feedback can be provided to the user. By catching security issues early, the risk of security incidents is greatly reduced.
