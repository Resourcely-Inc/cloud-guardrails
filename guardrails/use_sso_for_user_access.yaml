  Single Sign-On (SSO) for User Access: 
   - Implementing Single Sign-On (SSO) for user access simplifies the login process and reduces the number of credentials that need to be managed. 
   - This allows you to connect and use your workforce identities for accessing cloud services. 
   - There are several ways to implement SSO for user access in AWS, including using AWS IAM Identity Center, integrating with third-party identity providers (ie. Okta), or using custom solutions.
   - This recommendation is SSO-provider agnostic so choose the right SSO provider that fits your organizations requirements.
