summary: Enforce naming conventions for storage buckets with a unique prefix to avoid collisions.
how_to:
description: |
  Buckets are globally namespaced, so you should include a unique prefix (possibly your company name) to make collisions unlikely.
  Other good practices to add in bucket names:
   - the region buckets exist in
   - the application they are associated with
   - "public" for deliberately public buckets
