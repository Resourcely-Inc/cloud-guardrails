  You cannot fully avoid us-East-1.
  However, all companies utilizing AWS organizations should consider a SCP to deny all regions except those explicitly used/necessary to avoid attack surface sprawl.
  
  Only allow regions you operate in. To avoid unnecessary attack surface, cost, and complexity
  Would recommending avoiding us-west-1 because it is an old region and only has 2 AZ's.
  Although I would not recommdend denying us-east-1 region, I would recommend avoiding it if possible.
  us-east-1 has a lot of variation in AZs. (avoid use1-az3 aka us-east-1e)
  It is more of a mega region. Try us-east-2 instead.
