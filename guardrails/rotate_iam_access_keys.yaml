summary: Rotate IAM access keys where IAM users are still required
how_to:
description: >
  In the situations where IAM users are still required, or for existing IAM users 
  that haven not/can not be migrated to IAM roles, access keys should be rotated where applicable. 
  
  The frequency of key rotation may vary depending on your specific security requirements and the 
  level of risk associated with your application or infrastructure, but general guidance is to rotate
  when existing keys are 90 days old. 
  
  Regularly rotating access keys is important in maintaining the security of your infrastructure. 
  This practice limits the amount of time that an exposed key is valid for.
