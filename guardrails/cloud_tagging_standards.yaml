  A cloud tagging standard is the cornerstone of a well governed cloud environment. 
  A well-defined tagging strategy should define how tags are used to organize and manage AWS resources, 
    - including which tags are used, 
    - how they are applied, 
    - and who is responsible for managing them. 
  This strategy can assist with: 
    - resource tracking, 
    - cloud cost management, 
    - security, 
    - compliance, 
    - and incident management. 
  
  Resource level tagging, as opposed to account level tagging, allows for more granular visibility into cloud infrastructure. 
  To effectively manage AWS resources, it is essential to tag them with key information. 
  A non-comprehensive list of key information can include:
    - The responsible owner
  
  Attesting and attributing resources to a single owning team is an important practice for managing AWS resources. 
  The responsible owner should be a team distribution list, rather than an individual, to ensure that ownership of the resource is not lost when an individual leaves the organization. 
  Assigning ownership to a single team also ensures that there is a clear point of contact for any operational or security issues related to the resource.
    - Pagerduty (or equivalent) service ID
  
  This tag can help to quickly identify the appropriate owner to page in the event of an incident related to the resource.
    - Associated application(s)
  
  This tag can help to provide context around the resource, making it easier to manage and understand how it fits into the larger environment.
    - Short description of the purpose of the resource
  
  This tag should provide a brief description of the resource's purpose, making it easier to understand and manage.
    - Sensitivity level of data being handled/stored
  
  As a typical data-intensive application can share/spill data across many types of resources, tagging anything that is used to store or transit sensitive data types is critical. 
  This tag can be used to track sensitive data and to ensure that appropriate security controls are in place to protect sensitive information. 
    - Where (and possibly when) the resource configuration is managed/changed (if Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) is used)
  
  This tag can help identify where a resource is being managed. 
  Tying this to the IaC repo/build can provide for extremely granular attestation of changes. 
    - “This resource was changed in X commit  by Y person at Z time.”
  
  By implementing a standard tagging strategy that includes these key pieces of information, you can better manage and optimize your AWS resources. 
  Note that this is just a starting point, but this approach can lead to greater efficiency, cost savings, and improved security.
